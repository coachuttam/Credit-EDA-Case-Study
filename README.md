# Credit-EDA-Case-Study

## About the Dataset

## Introduction: 
This case study demonstrates how exploratory data analysis (EDA) can be applied in a real-world business scenario. The focus is on risk analytics in banking and financial services, specifically how data can be leveraged to minimize the risk of financial loss when lending to customers.

## Business Understanding: 
Loan providers face challenges in lending to customers with insufficient or no credit history, which can lead to defaults. In this scenario, we work for a consumer finance company specializing in urban loans. By using EDA, we aim to identify patterns in the data to ensure that creditworthy applicants are not unfairly rejected while minimizing the risk of default.

### When a loan application is submitted, the company must assess two key risks:

Failing to approve a loan for a reliable applicant results in lost business.
Approving a loan for a likely defaulter leads to financial losses.
The dataset provides information on two types of scenarios:

Payment difficulties: Applicants with delayed payments beyond X days in at least one of the first Y installments.
Timely payments: Applicants who make all payments on time.
Loan Decisions: When a client applies for a loan, the following outcomes are possible:

#### Approved: 
The loan application is approved.
#### Cancelled: 
The client cancels the application.
#### Refused: 
The loan is rejected by the company.
#### Unused offer: 
The loan offer was canceled by the client at some stage.
#### Business Objectives: 
The aim is to use EDA to uncover patterns indicating an applicantâ€™s likelihood of default. This can help the company take actions like denying loans, reducing loan amounts, or offering higher interest rates to riskier clients, ensuring that reliable customers are not rejected. Identifying key indicators of loan default is the main goal.
